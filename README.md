## Description

The purpose of this module is to configure existing Satellite/Foreman systems for remote execution (REX).

## Setup

Import module and publish/promote to appropriate CV/LCE.  Configure overrides overrides for the rex::params class.  The following is required, any additional can be tweeked to the desired value.

```
rex_keys = <% @host.params['remote_execution_ssh_keys'] %>
```

Following this, simply enable the rex and rex::params classes on the host[s] or host group[s] of your choosing.

**Note:** If you plan to use a user other than root, you must configure the `remote_execution_ssh_user` found in the Remote Execution portion of the Settings menu.

### What rex affects

This module will creat the REX user, if it is not already present and will manage this users password.  It will deploy sudo rules to /etc/sudoers.d/rex.  Finally, it will deploy the required ssh keys.

**Files affected:**
* user's home dir
* /etc/passwd
* /etc/shadow
* /etc/sudoers.d/rex
* $home_dir/.ssh/authorized_keys

**Warnings:**
* this module will not work correctly if using ldap (or other external) user
* this module will house the users encrypted password in the UI
* this module could cause unexpected security risks, if not properly configured

### Setup Requirements

If the desired ssh user for REX is not root, this must be configured prior to enabling this module.

### Beginning with rex

* import the module
* configure override for rex_keys
* enable module

## Usage

Additional user configurable parameters are available via the params class. These paramaters can be used to manage the REX user's password, set password policies, and the user comments field.

## Reference


## Limitations

This module will not work with external users for REX ssh user.
